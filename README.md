You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

Login API endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/auth/login.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
